Mouse Maze

Mouse Maze / Rat Race / Racin' Rats

Started as Mice in a maze, first to finish wins, but what one learns from one maze doesn't carry over to a new maze.... so...

Mice in maze aim to eat a complete breakfast (the "complete breakfast" can vary among mice) and there is limited food hidden in the maze

Mazes are procedurally generated and follow certain rules/conventions (For example Berry type food is always in the NorthWest, thus there is carry over knowledge for new mazes that the mice/rats can use)

Player could be another mouse among AI mice competing for its breakfast, or player could be a mad scientist who conducts these tests and could give feedback learning to mice

Mice in maze obey exaggerated physics (Run to fast before a turn and can't slow down -> Splat on the wall) (Like a racing game)

  Need to learn how to move quickly w/o dying to complete breakfast while food is still left

Snakes in maze that serve function of sentries (Mice must avoid or defeat these snakes) (like pacman ghosts)

Individual Mice could have characteristics like shyness/boldness that factor in when confronting snakes and could be influenced by player (scientist) feedback

Potential group dynamic among mice

Mice could form synergistic relationships by exchanging info (general food locations, i.e. Berries in NW) in order to increase each others survival

Choosing allies... not all can survive, but more than 1 could....

Mice would have to learn to navigate different structures like loops in mazes and avoiding running into walls.

Could be mouse traps loaded with cheese, maybe some already sprung (could learn to recognize)
